Please note that most of actual development has been moved to our internal corporate [GitLab](https://git.dms-serwis.com.pl/smokserwis).

To always have the latest versions of our packages, please install them using:
```bash
pip install --index-url https://git.dms-serwis.com.pl/api/v4/groups/330/-/packages/pypi/simple packageName
```

Report issues here, we'll still read them. You can safely fork our repositories and file pull requests. We'll do our best to keep our GitLab and GitHub in sync, but we promise nothing. We'll also try to upload packages to PyPI, but this will also be done on a best-effort basis.

**Note that there are still some packages that we haven't migrated yet, and they'll probably stay here**.
